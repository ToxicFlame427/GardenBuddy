This repository houses the publicly available code for Garden Buddy, the mobile application available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toxicflame427.gardenbuddy&hl=en_US&gl=US">Google Play</a> and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/garden-buddy-plant-assistant/id6737418328?platform=iphone">Apple App Store</a>.
I may have hidden some things in the files that can be searched for (No, this does not include the secret API keys silly, just a few easter eggs I had decided to hide for fun)

## Repository for version control
As I actively work on this application, the repository will consistently be updated per application update.

## About Garden Buddy
I had originally decided to create this application as means of getting gardening information readily available at your fingertips. When I first started getting into gardening, I always had to do all of the research on the plants I wanted to grow individually, so it got annoyiing really quick. So why not make an application that makes this process easier and shows all of the data you need to know all on one page? That is where my inspiration came from and thus resulted in the creation of this application. My <a href="http://toxicflame427.xyz">website</a> houses all sorts of information about this application (including screenshots), specifically on <a href="https://toxicflame427.xyz/pages/app_pages/garden_buddy.html">this page</a>.

Garden Buddy was originally created with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for the Android platform. I had realized that for this application to reach new users, I needed to make this application cross platform. I was originally writing the iOS version with Swift and SwiftUI, but quickly changes as that was a huge tak after swithing from native Android to native iOS. SO I had begun to look for a good crossplatrom library that suits my needs. This is where Flutter came into play; After so much research about how fast and easy Flutter is to use, this was the freamwork I had chosen for the job, and then this repository was born.

As this repository is public, any of the code anyone finds useful can be used by other developers. Any of the code files that include secret keys have been removed from version control as they need to be kept private by me (No, you arent allowed to using any of my admin keys :) ).
