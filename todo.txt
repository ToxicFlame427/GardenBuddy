To-do

Add page buttons to the plant search to see the other pages from search results.
Add the loading animations to the plant viewer and the scanner response screens.
Add an endpoint to accept plant suggestions
Add and endpoint to accept change requests (Along with a screen for that on the plant viewer activity, probably add a button to that next to the favorite button)
Keep working on the general plant viewer, adding more data
Handle GeminiAI exceptions when the server is under load (Common problem with Gemini API, try-catch)
Take screenshots to upload to website page for GB
(Maybe move report a bug to the tools page?)

Don't worry about code organiziation, that can be done after inital release when everything works
(Probably a bad idea ^^^ )
