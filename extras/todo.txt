To-do

Remove release jank on real devices, its not bad, but its very noticable
Add the license codes to the image viewer, also fix the box fit to fit the entire image not cover
Add an endpont to smaller images, loading times can be better and may help with jank
Keep working on adding more plants and images to the API system, this is SUPER important

Always worth refactoring
