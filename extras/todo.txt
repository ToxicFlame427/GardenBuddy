To-do

HIGH PRIORITY
New features:
Allow saving of AI chats to device - with sub
Allow saving of IDs and HAs to device - with sub
Work on the plant data edit request page
Reset app button (Its there, just make it work) - Deletes all cached data! Favorites, IDs, HAs, AI chats. KEEP THE DAY COUNT!
Change the favorite plants page so not all favorites are loaded in one go. Make it like the search page, only show 10 then the next after a button is tapped.

PARTIALLY FIXED - COULD BE IMPROVED
Remove release jank on real devices, its not bad, but its very noticable
Keep working on adding more plants and images to the API system, this is SUPER important.

LOW PRIORITY
Refactor code to reduce codebase - There are lots of things that could be rewritten better, just don't break anything >:(
